# Tools: R-, Python-, Excel
* This project shows the evaluation process of a teaching model as well as a prediction. 
* We use statistical methodology and machine learning algrithm through a specific case study. My goal is to provide a possible, feasible and reliable method to solve educational questions that challenge us in the long run.
* The dataset is extracted from a college group who study general math courses. 
* At the beginning, I give a visual description to the data in order to provide an overview of the data and the project questions I am trying to solve. After analyzing a small data, I make an initial assumption before obtaining a full dataset that will allow for further analysis using machine learning techniques.
